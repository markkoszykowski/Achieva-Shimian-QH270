# [Achieva Shimian QH270](https://www.amazon.com/Refurbished-ACHIEVA-SHIMIAN-QH270-2560x1440/dp/B00MDDN0HC) EDID

This repo contains the EDID binary (```shimian.bin```) required to set up the Achieva Shimian QH270 monitor on Linux (tested on Debian 11 "bullseye" with [Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter](https://www.apple.com/sg_smb_5200/shop/product/MB571Z/A/mini-displayport-to-dual-link-dvi-adapter)).
The EDID binary was extracted using [Monitor Asset Manager 2.9](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/moninfo.shtm) on Windows 11.

## Configuration files

Also included are the configuration files required to set up a triple monitor display configuration on the [Razer Blade 15" Advanced (2018) w/ GeForce GTX™ 1060](https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2572/~/at-a-glance%3A-razer-blade-15-advanced-%282018%29-%7C-rz09-0238x) running Debian 11 "bullseye".

Display configuration:
1) Built-in 1080p 144Hz display
2) [Samsung 27” T55 Curved Monitor](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/curved/27-t55-curved-monitor-lc27t550fdnxza/) via HDMI
3) [Achieva Shimian QH270](https://www.amazon.com/Refurbished-ACHIEVA-SHIMIAN-QH270-2560x1440/dp/B00MDDN0HC) w/ [Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter](https://www.apple.com/sg_smb_5200/shop/product/MB571Z/A/mini-displayport-to-dual-link-dvi-adapter) via Mini DisplayPort

The X Server configuration files included were produced according to [Chapter 34. Offloading Graphics Display with RandR 1.4](http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/515.65.01/README/randr14.html) of the Linux x64 NVIDIA Display Driver README (tested with NVIDIA Driver Version 515.65.01).
The ```xorg.conf``` was generated by running ```nvidia-xconfig --prime``` with root privileges and making appropriate edits to utilize the custom EDID.

PRIME Display Offloading is required on many laptops like the Razer Blade 15" due to the fact that the built-in display hardware is connected to the Intel integrated graphics, whereas external display ports' hardware is connected to the discrete GPU.

## Installation

```
$ cp ./.xsessionrc ~/
# cp ./xorg.conf /etc/X11/
# cp ./shimian.bin /etc/X11/    // Can be placed anywhere, however xorg.conf must be changed accordingly
```
